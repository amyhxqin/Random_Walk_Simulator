# Random_Walk_Simulator
This is a JS version of a 2D random walk simulator that I translated from a VBA model. A random walk is a mathematical object that simulates a path consisting of random steps on a mathematical space, such as a path consisting of either -1 or +1 on a number line. The random walk can be used to model different natural phenomena, such as the path traced by a molecule. 

My model generates and displays 3000 walks with 1000 steps each and computes the average number of steps and the root mean square translation distance.
